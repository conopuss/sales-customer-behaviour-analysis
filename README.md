# Sales & Customer Behaviour Analysis  

This project focuses on analysing sales and customer behaviour data from a simulated e-commerce company.  
The objective is to clean and merge datasets, engineer new features, and generate insights that can inform marketing and operational strategies.  

---

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Data Cleaning:** Standardised inconsistent labels, handled missing values, validated numeric columns, and removed duplicates.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new variables including revenue, price bands, order weeks, email domains, and delivery delay flags.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Generated summary tables and visualisations to explore patterns in sales and customer behaviour.  
- **Business Insights:** Answered key business questions about top revenue drivers, loyalty tiers, delivery delays, and the impact of discounts.

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses three CSV files:
- `sales_data.csv` – transaction-level details  
- `product_info.csv` – product metadata  
- `customer_info.csv` – customer demographics and loyalty information

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** for data cleaning & transformation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualisation  
- **Google Colab** for analysis and documentation  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Certain product categories drive significantly higher revenue in specific regions.  
- Discounts boost quantity sold, but not always overall revenue.  
- Gold loyalty tier customers generate the highest value.  
- Delivery delays are concentrated in specific regions and price bands.
